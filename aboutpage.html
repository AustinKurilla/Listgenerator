	<h2>Possible issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Items not deleting/Adding</li>
		<p>- The text box must be selected when you press delete or enter in order to add or remove items</p>
		<li>Mobile Responsiveness</li>
		<p>-Tried to make as mobile responsive as possible, having issues with theme and options selection bars on small screen sizes</p>
		<li>Text box staying at the top of the screen</li>
		<p>This feature works somewhat, uses position:sticky top:0 having issues with it saying at the top when scrolling far down possibly due to the list overflowing 
		when there is a significant amount of data </p>
		</ul>
